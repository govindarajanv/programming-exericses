- Write a program that follows the rules of object-oriented programming and will calculate the area of the rectangle.

  You need to create two classes, one RectangleArea for the logic of your program and the Main class. In the Main class, we create the RectangleArea object and call three methods on it.

  The methods you should create are:

  getData(), gets side lengths from the
  computeField(), performs
  fieldDisplay(), displays info and result.
